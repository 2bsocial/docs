2bsocial Privacy Policy
2bsocial, LLC is devoted to protecting the privacy rights of our users. This Privacy Policy informs you about how we collect, store, use, and manage the information you provide in connection with any 2bsocial game or application ("Service").
By using the Service, you are agreeing to the collection and use of your personal information as outlined in this Privacy Policy. We may amend the Privacy Policy from time to time. Please consult the Privacy Policy regularly for changes.

Information Collected and Used
The goal of collecting user information by 2bsocial is to provide and enhance the Service. When you install any of the 2bsocial games or applications, we may collect and record the information you provide us voluntarily in accordance with the policies and terms of Facebook.
The "personal information", defined as information about you that can be used to contact or identify you, may include: your name, Facebook user identification number, or email address. Additionally, we may acquire information from you through your access and participation in message boards on the Service; your email of a question to our customer support; your purchase of a virtual product of any type.

Please note that because a third party site manages the purchases of virtual goods offered by the Service, we do not have access to your credit card details and billing information.

In addition to information collected as described above, you may choose to share additional information about yourself throughout the Service, such as in games or on message boards. Any action you perform with other players are considered public, and are your sole discretion.

The information you provide will not be disclosed, rented, leased, loaned, sold, or otherwise voluntarily distributed to unaffiliated third parties and will be used solely for the purpose of providing you with and improving the Service.

Links
The Service may contain links to other websites. The fact that the Service links to a website or presents a banner ad or other type of advertisement does not mean that 2bsocial endorses or authorizes that third party, nor is it a representation of our affiliation with that third party. 2bsocial is in no way responsible for the privacy policies of these other websites to which you chose to access from the Service.
